# Multiverse 
######February 2014 - April 2014
 
Multiverse is supposed to be about exploring the universe. The original inspiration was my math class at the time. We just started trigonometry, and so I wanted to make a game that used a lot of trig. After I got more into making the game, the goal became to make a peaceful experience exploring a universe, mostly inspired by the game Thomas was Alone (as you'll see, I use the song *Freedom* from the game). This project was a huge leap for me because I learned how to do more complex things with C++, and I became much better at solving problems I faced in programming because I had to spend several hours thinking about how to recreate accurate physics in the collisions between objects (I had not taken physics in school yet, and I didn't want to have to look anything up).

I didn't expect to get as far as I did in this project (I didn't get close to my ambitious goals in my previous project), so when I achieved my original goal I wasn't sure what to do next. For a little while I tried to come up with new ideas, and amped up the goal to adding black holes that sent you to alternate universes that were all connected (hence the name "Multiverse"), but I quickly decided to just move on to something new so I could have a fresh start.

 
##Controls (Xbox controller)
#####Move: Left stick
#####Reach camera: Right stick
#####Zoom in: Left bumper
#####Zoom out: Right bumper
#####Take off: A

##NOTE: 
- When the game starts, you probably will have to zoom out **a lot** in order to find your way to a solar system.
- To land on a planet you have to collide with it at a slow speed.
